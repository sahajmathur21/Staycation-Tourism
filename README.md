# Staycation-Tourism

Staycation Tourism Application is designed to cater to the growing demand for digital solutions in the tourism sector. With the rising trend of online bookings, personalized travel experiences, and the need for effective management of customer data, this application serves as an essential tool for travel agencies and tourists alike. Built using Java Swing and AWT for the graphical user interface (GUI) and SQL for backend database management, this project aims to streamline the entire process of booking, managing, and analyzing tours and travel packages.

Tourism is one of the most significant industries globally, and a robust application that simplifies processes such as booking management, customer tracking, tour package handling, and financial operations is essential to success. This application is intended to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly system that allows both tourists and travel operators to manage their respective needs efficiently. The project demonstrates the practical implementation of a tourism system where technology meets business operations, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organization.
